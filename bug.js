This error occurs when using the `FlatList` component in React Native and providing an invalid `keyExtractor` function.  The `keyExtractor` function is crucial for performance and efficient rendering. If it doesn't return a unique key for each item, React Native may struggle to identify and update items correctly, leading to inconsistent rendering or unexpected behavior.  For example, if you're using an array of objects and your `keyExtractor` is simply `(item) => item.id`, but some `id` values are duplicated, this error is likely to appear.  The `key` prop of the item will be the same as another item, making it difficult to differentiate.

```javascript
<FlatList
  data={[{ id: 1, name: 'Item 1' }, { id: 2, name: 'Item 2' }, { id: 1, name: 'Item 3' }]}
  renderItem={({ item }) => <Text>{item.name}</Text>}
  keyExtractor={(item) => item.id} // Duplicate IDs cause issues
/>
```
